# 🧑‍🏫 Trainer Version: The AI Literacy Framework 

*This guide contains the **Answer Key**, **Facilitation Strategy**, and a **Troubleshooting Guide** to manage the technical and conceptual hurdles participants often face during AI training.*

---

## **Part 1: The Mental Model (How AI "Thinks")**

**Trainer Goal:** Dismantle the "Magic Box" myth. Participants must stop viewing AI as a "conscious being" and start seeing it as a **statistical calculator**.

### **Activity 1: The "Fallible Intern" Reflection**

* **The Risk: If you ask a "people-pleaser" a question they don't know, what will they do?**
* **Trainer Key:** They will **hallucinate**. They prioritize "looking helpful" over "being accurate." They will invent plausible-sounding facts to satisfy the user's prompt.


* **The Solution: How does your management style change?**
* **Trainer Key:** You move from **Trust** to **Verification**. You provide clear boundaries, ask for sources, and never take the first draft as a finished product.

## **Part 2: The P.R.T.C. Architecture**

**Trainer Goal:** Move participants from "Chatting" to "Prompt Engineering."

### **Exercise: The Prompt Surgeon (Example Answers)**

* **Persona:** "You are a Senior Registered Dietitian specializing in longevity."
* **Request:** "Analyze pantry staples and draft a 7-day meal plan."
* **Target:** "A single parent with limited time and energy."
* **Constraints:** "No specialty stores; prep time under 20 mins; avoid high-sodium meats."

## **Part 3: Ethics, Bias, & The "Human Filter"**

**Trainer Goal:** Recognize that AI reflects the flaws of the data it was fed.

* **The Socratic Check:** Teach participants to ask the AI: *"List three reasons why your previous answer might be biased."* This forces the model to "attend" to its own statistical blind spots.

## **Part 4: Tool Selection (Strategic Mapping)**

**Trainer Goal:** Match the tool to the "Blast Radius" of the task.

* **Trainer Tip:** Emphasize that **NotebookLM** uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to stay grounded in *your* documents, effectively "handcuffing" the AI to the truth.

## **🛠️ Trainer’s Troubleshooting Guide**

This section addresses the most common "Stuck Points" during the workshop.

### **1. The "Sentience" Trap**

* **The Misconception:** Participants talk to the AI like it’s a person, getting frustrated when it "lies" or "forgets."
* **Trainer Fix:** Use the **Mirror Analogy**. "The AI isn't lying to you; it’s reflecting the most likely next word in its training data. If you give it a bad prompt, the mirror is blurry. It doesn't have a soul; it has a spreadsheet of probabilities."

### **2. The "It’s Faster to Do it Myself" Objection**

* **The Misconception:** Participants spend 10 minutes trying to prompt an AI for a 2-minute task.
* **Trainer Fix:** Explain the **Template Value**. "You aren't just doing this one task. You are building a **P.R.T.C. Template** you can use 100 times. We are investing in a reusable workflow, not just a single output."

### **3. The "AI is a Search Engine" Habit**

* **The Misconception:** Participants ask for current prices or specific URLs (which often lead to 404 errors).
* **Trainer Fix:** Clarify **Knowledge Cut-offs**. "LLMs are like a library that was locked three years ago. If you want the 'now,' you need to use a tool with web-search enabled (like Gemini) or upload your own current data (NotebookLM)."

### **4. Ethical Paralysis**

* **The Misconception:** Participants are afraid to use AI because they feel it is "cheating" or "replacing" them.
* **Trainer Fix:** The **Calculator vs. Mathematician** distinction. "Using a calculator didn't stop people from doing math; it allowed them to do *bigger* math. AI handles the syntax so you can focus on the **strategy**."

## **Part 5: Knowledge Retention Quiz (Answer Key)**

1. **Why "Prediction" vs "Search"?** A Search Engine points you to a file. A Prediction Engine **creates** a new sequence of tokens.
2. **What is a "Hallucination"?** Confident, grammatically correct, but factually false output.
3. **True or False?** **False.** Confidence is a mathematical probability, not a truth-value.
4. **How do "Constraints" improve results?** They reduce the "Search Space," preventing the AI from falling into generic, low-value patterns.
