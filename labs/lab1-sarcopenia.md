## Step 1: Generate the Article (Gemini)

1. Open **Gemini**
   👉 [https://gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)

2. Paste the following prompt **exactly** into Gemini:

```
Write a 1,000-word article titled “Muscle Strength for Seniors: Beating Sarcopenia.”

The article should explain sarcopenia in clear, non-technical language and emphasize that muscle strength can be rebuilt at any age.

Include two core sections:

1. Safe, Equipment-Free Strength Training

List and explain 5 senior-safe exercises (e.g., chair squats, wall push-ups, heel raises, bird-dogs, standing side leg lifts).

Provide simple instructions, safety cues, and daily-life benefits for each exercise.

Emphasize balance, fall prevention, and independence rather than appearance or intensity.

2. Nutrition for Muscle Maintenance & Growth

Explain the importance of adequate protein intake for seniors (including anabolic resistance).

Recommend practical protein targets per meal (not just per day).

Include examples of easy-to-digest, senior-friendly protein foods (e.g., eggs, fish, yogurt, tofu, beans).

Briefly cover hydration and key nutrients that support muscle function (e.g., vitamin D, omega-3s).

Use a warm, encouraging, and confidence-building tone.
Avoid fitness hype or medical jargon.
Focus on safety, consistency, and quality of life.
```

3. Review the generated article.

   * Ensure language is calm and senior-appropriate
   * Confirm all 5 exercises are clearly explained
   * No medical jargon or aggressive fitness claims

---

## Step 2: Save the Article as a PDF

1. Copy the final article into a **Google Doc**.

2. From Google Docs:

   * Click **File → Download → PDF (.pdf)**

3. Save the file as:

   ```
   sarcopenia-guide.pdf
   ```

📌 *This PDF will be the single input for the video generation step.*

---

## Step 3: Generate a Video from the PDF (Free AI Tool)

1. Open **Canva**
   👉 [https://www.canva.com/](https://www.canva.com/)

2. Click **Create → Video**
   (or search for **“AI Video Generator”**).

3. Upload your file:

   ```
   sarcopenia-guide.pdf
   ```

4. Let Canva automatically:

   * Convert sections into slides
   * Extract headings and key points
   * Apply basic layouts

5. Make light adjustments if needed:

   * Large, readable fonts
   * Simple visuals or icons
   * Slow transitions
   * Minimal background music

6. Export the final output as an **MP4 video**.

📌 *Aim for clarity, calm pacing, and readability for seniors—not flashy effects.*

## Deliverables

By the end of this lab, you should have:

* ✅ A 1,000-word AI-generated article
* ✅ A PDF health guide for seniors
* ✅ A short AI-generated educational video

---

## Key Learning Takeaway

This lab shows how **AI can turn written knowledge into accessible video education** with almost no technical setup:

> **One prompt → one PDF → one video**

The focus is on:

* Clear communication
* Safety-first health education
* Improving quality of life for seniors
