* AI trained on **billions of texts** to predict language patterns
* Analogy: **Autocomplete on steroids**
* Strength: Generate essays, summaries, translations
* Limitation: Can hallucinate; depends on quality prompts

**Slide 6 – Tokenization**

* Text broken into **tokens** (letters, words, subwords)
* Analogy: Lego bricks → AI builds “sentences” from pieces
* Helps AI understand context and generate coherent outputs

**Slide 7 – Knowledge Check #2**
Q: Tokenization is:
A. Breaking text into chunks ✅
B. Encrypting datasets
C. Splitting models
D. Organizing databases

**Slide 10 – Knowledge Check #3**
Q: If you want to summarize your own PDF, which tool do you use?
A. Gemini
B. NotebookLM ✅

---

## **Module 4: The P.R.T.C. Prompting Framework**

**Slide 11 – Why Prompting Matters**

* AI is **literal**: vague prompts → generic answers

Q: What should you do if AI gives a confident but strange answer?
A. Trust it blindly
B. Verify with reliable sources ✅

---

## **Module 8: Machine Learning Essentials**

**Slide 22 – Core Concepts**

* AI technique learning patterns from data = ML
* **Supervised Learning:** labeled data (e.g., kNN)
* **Unsupervised Learning:** unlabeled data (e.g., k-Means)
* **Overfitting/Underfitting:** model too rigid or too weak

**Slide 23 – Knowledge Check #8**
Q: Overfitting occurs when:
A. Model learns noise + patterns → poor on new data ✅
B. Model generalizes well
C. Model ignores labels
