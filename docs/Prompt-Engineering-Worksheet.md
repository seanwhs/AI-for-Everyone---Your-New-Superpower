# 🚀 Prompt Engineering Worksheet

This toolkit is designed to move you beyond "chatting" and into "engineering." Use this workspace to practice the **P.R.T.C. Method** across diverse, real-world scenarios.

**Name:** __________________________

**Goal:** Master the P.R.T.C. (Persona, Request, Target, Context) bridge.

---

### ## Part 1: The P.R.T.C. Framework

| Pillar | Definition | Key Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P — Persona** | Who is the AI? | Assign a level of expertise (e.g., Senior Analyst). |
| **R — Request** | What is the job? | Use a specific action verb (e.g., Summarize, Draft). |
| **T — Target** | What is the format? | Define the output (e.g., Table, Email, List). |
| **C — Context** | What are the rules? | Set the tone, audience, or constraints. |

### ## Part 2: Hands-On Challenges

#### **Challenge 1: The Insurance Decoder (Complex Literacy)**

* **Scenario:** You received a 30-page Home Insurance renewal. You need to know if your "Flood Coverage" changed, but the legal language is dense.
* **Vague Prompt:** *"Does my insurance cover floods?"*
* **P.R.T.C. Goal:** Ask the AI to act as a **Claims Adjuster**, scan for "Flood" exclusions, and present a **Risk vs. Benefit table**.
* **Draft your prompt:** ____________________________________________________________________

#### **Challenge 2: The "Hard Conversation" (Conflict Resolution)**

* **Scenario:** A neighbor’s dog barked all night again. You need to send a firm but polite WhatsApp message that avoids a "neighborhood war."
* **P.R.T.C. Goal:** Act as a **Conflict Resolution Expert**. Target **three options**: (1) Friendly, (2) Professional, (3) Short. Context: Mention your early meeting.
* **Draft your prompt:** ____________________________________________________________________

#### **Challenge 3: The "Kitchen Scientist" (Zero-Waste Logic)**

* **Scenario:** You have wilted kale, chickpeas, pesto, and rice. You need a high-protein meal in under 20 minutes.
* **P.R.T.C. Goal:** Act as a **Zero-Waste Chef**. Constraint: **One-pot only** to save on cleaning.
* **Draft your prompt:** ____________________________________________________________________

#### **Challenge 4: The Tokenization "Brain-Hack"**

* **Concept:** AI sees "Unconventional" as chunks (Tokens). Break **"DISCONNECTED"** into tokens below:
* **Your Guess:** `[________]` + `[________]` + `[________]`
* **The Lesson:** AI treats "ed" as a "Past Tense" Lego brick, which is why it understands grammar so well.

### **Solution for challenge 4**

For the word **"DISCONNECTED"**, the AI typically breaks it into these three tokens:

1. `[DIS]` (The Prefix)
2. `[CONNECT]` (The Root)
3. `[ED]` (The Suffix)

### **Why this matters**

This "Lego brick" approach is the secret to AI’s intelligence. Instead of memorizing millions of individual words, the AI learns the **logic** of the pieces:

* **Grammar Logic:** By isolating `[ED]`, the AI knows that any word ending in this token likely refers to the past. It doesn't need to be taught "walked," "jumped," and "connected" separately; it just learns the rule of the `[ED]` brick.
* **Meaning Logic:** By isolating `[DIS]`, the AI understands "negation" or "reversal." If it knows what "connect" means, the `[DIS]` brick tells it that the meaning is now the opposite.
* **Efficiency:** This allows the AI to understand words it has **never seen before**. If a new word is invented tomorrow, the AI will break it into known tokens to "guess" the meaning with high accuracy.

#### **Challenge 5: The "Hallucination" Trap (Critical Thinking)**

* **Task:** Ask the AI for three 5-star restaurants in a tiny, remote village near you.
* **The Result:** Did it invent a restaurant?
* **My Finding:** __________________________________________________________________________

### ## Part 3: The Prompt Refiner (Troubleshooting)

When the first answer isn't perfect, **iterate.** Use this guide to diagnose and fix the issue.

| Problem | Diagnosis | The Fix (Follow-up Prompt) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Too wordy** | Missing Constraints | "Simplify this into 3 bullet points, under 15 words each." |
| **Cold/Formal tone** | Weak Persona | "Change Persona to a supportive mentor. Make it warmer." |
| **Making things up** | Loose Context | "Use ONLY the uploaded text. If not found, say 'I don't know'." |
| **Too generic** | Basic Persona | "Act as an Expert Data Analyst. Critique this for gaps." |
| **Wall of text** | Missing Template | "Convert this list into a side-by-side comparison table." |

### ## Part 4: Live Refinement Exercise

**Scenario:** Saving on electricity.

1. **Original Prompt:** "Tell me how to save money on my electricity bill."
2. **Refinement 1 (Target):** "Turn that into a checklist for my fridge."
3. **Refinement 2 (Constraint):** "Only include tips that cost $0 to implement."
4. **Refinement 3 (Persona):** "Act as a grumpy landlord; rewrite the list to be very strict."

### ## Part 5: My Personal AI Strategy

Identify three areas where you will stop "asking" and start "engineering" this week:

* **At Work:** ____________________________________________________________________________
* **At Home:** ____________________________________________________________________________
* **For Learning:** _________________________________________________________________________

> **💡 Final Pro-Tip: The "Ask Me Questions" Rule**
> If you are stuck, tell the AI: *"I want to [Goal]. Act as a Prompt Engineer. Ask me 5 questions about my P.R.T.C. so you can build the perfect prompt for me."*
