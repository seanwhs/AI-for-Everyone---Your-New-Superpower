## Objective

Transform technical or poetic text into an original song using NotebookLM’s creative audio capabilities.

## Step 1: Preparation (The Lyrics)

1. Open the lyrics for **《晨光》** provided in your project folder.
2. Copy the entire text, including the structure tags like **[Verse]**, **[Chorus]**, and **[Bridge]**.
3. Save this text as a **PDF** or a **Google Doc** titled "Morning Light Lyrics."

## Step 2: The Studio (NotebookLM)

1. Open [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/).
2. Create a new notebook titled **"AI Music Project."**
3. Upload your **Morning Light Lyrics** PDF as the primary source.
4. **Context Check:** Ask the chat, "What is the emotional tone of these lyrics?" to ensure the AI understands the "gentle" and "hopeful" themes.

## Step 3: Audio Generation

1. Click on **Notebook Guide** in the bottom right corner.
2. Look for the **Deep Dive Audio Overview** section.
3. Click **Generate**.
4. **The Result:** NotebookLM will generate a conversational "podcast" where the AI hosts discuss the song's meaning, structure, and emotional weight, effectively bringing the written lyrics to life through verbal analysis and synthetic performance.

> **Note:** While NotebookLM creates an "Audio Overview" (a discussion about the text), you can prompt the chat to "Write a melody description for these lyrics" to help you imagine how the song would sound in different genres!
