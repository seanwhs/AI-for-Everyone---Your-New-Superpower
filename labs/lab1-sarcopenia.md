## Step 1: Research (Gemini)

1. Use the **Consultant Prompt** in Gemini to generate a 700-word article.
   > Act as a Senior Health Consultant. Write a **700-word** article titled "Beating Sarcopenia: A Senior’s Guide to Strength." Focus on **leucine-rich nutrition** and a **5-step resistance routine**. Use an encouraging tone, clear headings, and bullet points. Include a safety disclaimer.

3. Ensure it has a 5-step exercise routine.
4. Download the text as a **PDF**.
