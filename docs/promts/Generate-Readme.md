### 💡 Why this prompt works for your course:

* **The "Role" (Instructional Designer):** Forces the AI to think about the *learner’s experience*, not just the technical facts.
* **The "Context" (GitHub Repo):** Ensures the output is formatted correctly in Markdown for immediate copy-pasting into your `README.md` file.
* **The "Specific Lab":** By mentioning Sarcopenia specifically, it makes the curriculum feel grounded and real, rather than a generic "how to use AI" guide.

### 🚀 A Quick Tip for your GitHub Pages:

To **GitHub Pages**, can  ask Gemini to: *"Convert the README.md content into a simple **HTML/CSS landing page** that looks modern and mobile-friendly."* This will give us the actual code to make your course website look beautiful!
