## **Part 1: The Mental Model (How AI "Thinks")**

Before using the tool, you must understand the engine. AI does not "know" facts; it calculates the **probability of the next token**. It is essentially "Autocomplete on Steroids."

### **Activity 1: The "Fallible Intern" Reflection**

Imagine you have hired a brilliant intern who has read every book in the world but has **zero common sense** and a tendency to **please you at any cost**.

* **The Risk:** If you ask a "people-pleaser" a question they don't know, what will they do?
* *Reflection:* ___________________________________________________________


* **The Solution:** How does your management style change if you know your intern might "hallucinate" (make things up) to make you happy?
* *Reflection:* ___________________________________________________________

## **Part 2: The P.R.T.C. Architecture**

*Prompting is the art of reducing ambiguity.* Use this grid to "build" a high-fidelity thought process. By defining these four pillars, you move from "asking" to "engineering" a result.

| Component | Strategic Purpose | The "Thinking" Behind It |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P — Persona** | Sets the **Expertise** | *Whose perspective is most valuable for this specific problem?* |
| **R — Request** | Sets the **Action** | *Am I asking for a list, a critique, a draft, or a transformation?* |
| **T — Target** | Sets the **Empathy** | *Who is the end-user, and what is their current state of mind?* |
| **C — Constraints** | Sets the **Quality** | *What are the "guardrails" that prevent generic or unsafe output?* |

### **Exercise: The Prompt Surgeon**

**Weak Prompt:** "Explain how to eat healthy for weight loss."

**The Surgery:** Apply **P.R.T.C.** to make this actionable.

* **Persona:** (e.g., A metabolic health researcher) ___________________________
* **Request:** (e.g., Create a 7-day high-protein meal plan) ____________________
* **Target:** (e.g., A busy parent who can't cook for more than 20 mins) __________
* **Constraints:** (e.g., No expensive supplements, must be under $50 total) _______

## **Part 3: The "Brain Teaser" Lab (Thinking Exercises)**

*Solve these scenarios using your new mental models.*

**Scenario A: The Logic Trap**
You ask an AI to "summarize the latest news on a specific local event." The AI gives a very detailed summary, but you realize the event hasn't happened yet.

* **The Thinking Challenge:** Why did the AI do this? Which part of the "Fallible Intern" model explains this behavior?
* *Answer:* ___________________________________________________________



**Scenario B: The Persona Shift**
You are trying to learn how to use Excel.

* **Task:** Write down how the output would change if you set the **Persona** to:
1. *An angry drill sergeant:* __________________________________________
2. *A patient kindergarten teacher:* ____________________________________

## **Part 4: Ethics, Bias, & The "Human Filter"**

AI is trained on human data—which means it inherits human **biases**. It reflects the data it was fed, which is often skewed toward specific demographics or viewpoints.

### **The "3-Step Verification" Model**

Before adopting an AI's suggestion, run it through this filter:

1. **The Source Check:** If I asked a human expert this, would they agree?
2. **The Bias Check:** Is this advice assuming everyone has the same amount of money, time, or physical ability?
3. **The "Socratic" Check:** Ask the AI: *"List three reasons why the advice you just gave me might be wrong or biased."*

### **Activity: Ethical Dilemmas**

* **Scenario:** You use AI to write a recommendation letter for a friend. The AI uses words you would never use.
* **Thinking Point:** Is the letter still "from you"? Where is the line between **assistance** and **impersonation**?
* *Reflection:* ___________________________________________________________

## **Part 5: Tool Selection (Strategic Mapping)**

Knowing which tool to use is half the battle. We distinguish between "The Open Sea" (General AI) and "The Walled Garden" (Grounded AI).

[Image comparing Retrieval-Augmented Generation vs standard Large Language Models]

| If your goal is... | Use this "Brain" | Because... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Brainstorming** | **Gemini / ChatGPT** | They have "Creative Breadth" (The Open Sea). |
| **Fact-Checking Docs** | **NotebookLM** | It uses **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to stay grounded. |
| **Learning a Skill** | **Gemini (with PRTC)** | It can simulate a tutor/expert interaction. |

## **Part 6: Knowledge Retention Quiz**

1. **Why is AI called a "Prediction Engine" rather than a "Search Engine"?**
---


2. **What is a "Hallucination" in AI terms?**
---


3. **True or False:** If the AI sounds confident, the information is definitely correct.
---


4. **How do "Constraints" in a prompt improve the final result?**
---

## 💡 **The Golden Rule for the AI Era**

> **"Do not delegate your thinking. Delegate your chores."**

*Use AI to handle the heavy lifting of drafting, formatting, and summarizing—but keep the **judgment** and **final approval** strictly for yourself.*
