# 📂 Lab: AI Travel Co-Pilot Workshop

**Subject:** Digital Planning for Cross-Border Transit Logistics

**Case Study:** Pontian via Larkin Sentral (Jan/Feb 2026)

**Objective:** Leverage AI to plan a budget-friendly (S$500) 3-day trip using Buses and Grab.

---

## 🟢 Part 1: The "Master Prompt" (Multi-Leg Transit)

*Because you are transiting through Larkin, the AI needs to account for transfer times and regional bus schedules (like Maju or Causeway Link).*

**Task:** Copy and paste this prompt into Gemini or ChatGPT.

> **Master Prompt:**
> "Act as a Johor transit expert. Plan a **3-day Singapore couple's trip to Pontian** for Jan/Feb 2026.
> * **Route:** Singapore (Pinnacle@Duxton) to 'Larkin Sentral' to  'Pontian Bus Interchange'.
> * **Transport:** Public Bus (e.g., SBS/Causeway Link) and Grab only.
> * **Payment:** Cash, Credit Card, and Grab App.
> * **Accommodation:** Recommend a hotel in Pontian Kechil within **walking distance of the Bus Interchange** that is clean and safe.
> * **Interests:** High priority on **Heng Heng Wanton Mee**, **Fresh Seafood**, and **Tanjung Piai**.
> * **Constraint:** Provide a 'Plan B' for monsoon rain in the afternoons."

## 🟡 Part 2: Fact-Checking & Transit Verification

*Larkin is a massive hub. AI will help you navigate the specific platforms and 2026 requirements.*

**Task:** Use a search-enabled AI to verify these 2026 details:

1. **Larkin to Pontian:** *"What are the current bus numbers from Larkin Sentral to Pontian Interchange in 2026? (e.g., Maju 96 or Causeway Link 606). What is the frequency?"*
2. **Payment Systems:** *"Can I use a Credit Card for regional buses from Larkin to Pontian, or is it strictly Cash/ManjaLink in 2026?"*
3. **Grab Surge:** *"Estimate the Grab fare from Pontian Bus Interchange to Tanjung Piai during a monsoon rain surge."*

## 🔵 Part 3: The "Monsoon-Ready" Security Gear

*As a security officer, you know that being 'on foot' during a monsoon requires better waterproof 'Access Control' for your gear.*

**Task:** Ask the AI to generate a list for a **Public Transport traveler**.

### **Officer's Transit Packing List (Integrated Content):**

* **The "Dry Hub" Bag:** A **waterproof backpack cover** or dry bag. Since you’ll be walking between bus bays, keeping your clothes dry is priority #1.
* **Footwear:** **Anti-slip tactical sandals** or shoes. Larkin and Pontian terminal floors become slip hazards ("Code Grey" zones) when wet.
* **Tech:** A **Power Bank** and a **physical printout** of your hotel booking. If the rain kills your phone, you need a hard copy to show a taxi driver.
* **Cash Management:** A **waterproof pouch** for Ringgit. Many regional buses still prefer exact change (Cash).

## 🏨 Part 4: Transit-Centric Accommodation

*Without a car, your hotel choice is your 'Base of Operations.' It must be near the Pontian Bus Interchange.*

**Task:** Compare these AI-selected hotels (approx. S$50–$70/night):

1. **Wan Loong Hotel:** (~100m from Interchange). The ultimate transit hotel. No Grab needed to check in.
2. **The Oikos Hotel:** (~300m from Interchange). Modern and close to the **Heng Heng Wanton Mee** stall.
3. **Princess Hotel:** (~800m from Interchange). Use a **Grab** (approx. RM 5) from the bus terminal if it's raining.

## 🟠 Part 5: Indoor "Plan B" (Wait Out the Rain)

*When the rain hits, stay undercover. Use the Grab app to hop between these spots.*

**Task:** Research these indoor spots in Pontian Kechil:

1. **Yearn Cafe:** Minimalist and air-conditioned. Great for "Admin Time" to plan your next move.
2. **Red People Cafe (红人馆):** A cozy spot to wait for the rain to stop before heading to a seafood dinner.
3. **Pontian Plaza:** A local mall near the terminal. Good for last-minute "Shopping" or local snacks under a solid roof.

## 🔴 Part 6: The Budget Breakdown ($500 SGD Target)

*Public transport is cheaper than driving, allowing for a better "Seafood Fund."*

## 📝 Lab Reflection (The "Human Touch")

1. **AI Discovery:** Did the AI mention that **Heng Heng Wanton Mee** is just a short walk from the Pontian terminal? ____________________
2. **Critical Check:** Have you downloaded the **Grab App** and linked a **Credit Card** for seamless payment in MYR? ____________________
3. **Officer's Perspective:** Navigating Larkin Sentral during a monsoon—does it require more "Crowd Control" skills than a busy day at SGH? ____________________
