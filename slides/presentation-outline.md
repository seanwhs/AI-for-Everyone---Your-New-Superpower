### 🎨 Design Tips for the Trainer:

* **Keep it Visual:** Use large, friendly icons instead of long paragraphs.
* **Live Demos:** Nothing beats a live demo. Show yourself asking Gemini for a "3-ingredient recipe for dinner" to get a laugh and show immediate value.
* **The "Audio Overview":** When you get to the NotebookLM section, play the AI-generated audio through the room's speakers. It usually shocks and delights the learners.
