### 🏨 Recommended Accommodation: The Oikos Hotel

* **Location:** 4-minute walk (300m) from **Pontian Bus Interchange**.
* **Why:** It is modern, clean, and significantly safer for couples compared to older budget hotels. It puts you right in the "food zone" so you don't need a Grab for breakfast or dinner.

### 💡 Expert Tips for the Security Officer

1. **Code Grey Prevention:** The floors at Larkin and Pontian Interchange are **extremely slippery** when wet. Wear shoes with tactical-grade grip.
2. **Access Control:** Download the **"Beat the Jam"** app. Check the Tuas/Woodlands camera feed before you leave Pinnacle@Duxton to decide which bridge to take.
3. **Communication:** Ensure your Grab app is linked to a **Credit Card** (like YouTrip or Trust) to avoid carrying excessive cash, though you should keep RM 150 in small notes for the regional buses.

To finalize your mission plan, here is the **Transit Addendum**. This serves as a "quick-glance" tactical sheet for your departure and arrival, specifically for the **January/February 2026** monsoon season.

---

### 🚍 Addendum: Cross-Border Transit Schedule (2026)

#### **1. Departure: Singapore (Queen Street) to Larkin Sentral**

Since you are starting at **Pinnacle@Duxton**, take a 10-minute Grab or the East-West Line to Bugis. Walk to the **Queen Street Terminal**.

| Service | Frequency | First/Last Bus | Payment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Causeway Link (CW2)** | Every 15–20 mins | 06:00 AM / 11:30 PM | Visa / Mastercard / ManjaLink |
| **SJE (Yellow Bus)** | Every 30 mins | 06:30 AM / 10:30 PM | **Cash Only** (S5.00) |

* **Officer’s Note:** In 2026, the CW2 is the most efficient choice because it allows **Contactless Visa/Mastercard** taps, reducing time spent at the ticket booth.

---

#### **2. Connection: Larkin Sentral to Pontian Interchange**

Once you clear immigration and arrive at Larkin, head to the **Centralized Ticketing System (CTS)** counters in the main lobby.

* **Bus Companies:** Look for **Maju (Bus 96)** or **Causeway Link (606)**.
* **Fare:** Approx. **RM 6.00 – RM 8.00** per person.
* **Platform:** Check your printed ticket for the "Platform Gate" (usually Gates 1–10).

* **Last Bus:** Usually 08:30 PM (Do not arrive later than this!)



---

#### **3. The "Grab" Contingency (Wet Weather Backup)**

If the monsoon rain is too heavy or you miss the last bus at Larkin, use the **Grab App**.

* **Larkin to Pontian (Grab):** Estimated **RM 65 – RM 90**.
* **Security Tip:** Ensure your Grab app is set to **"Card Payment"** so you don't have to fumble with wet ringgit notes during a downpour.

---

### 📋 Final "Pre-Trip" Checklist

* [ ] **Passport:** At least 6 months validity.
* [ ] **MDAC:** Check if the Malaysia Digital Arrival Card is required for land entry (Exempt for Singaporeans in 2026, but worth a 10-second AI check before you leave).
* [ ] **Power:** Power bank fully charged (Public transport is a battery drainer).
* [ ] **Small Change:** Keep **RM 50 in RM 1 and RM 5 notes** specifically for the Pontian bus terminal toilets or small snacks.
