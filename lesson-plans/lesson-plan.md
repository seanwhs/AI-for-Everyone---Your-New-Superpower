### 1. Lesson Plan (9:00 - 16:30)

| Time | Session | Trainer’s Tactical Objective | The "Aha!" Moment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **09:00** | **The Hook** | **Icebreaking & Fear Reduction.** Start with a live demo of Gemini making a mistake to humanize the tech. | When students realize the AI isn't a "God," but a very helpful, fallible intern. |
| **10:30** | **Coffee Break** | *Trainer Check:* Ensure everyone has successfully logged into Gemini. |  |
| **10:45** | **Gemini 101** | **Mastering PRTC.** Moving from "Google Search" behavior to "Managerial Instruction." | When a 3-word prompt fails, but a 30-word PRTC prompt creates a perfect meal plan. |
| **12:00** | **Lunch** | *Trainer Task:* Identify 2-3 "struggling" students for a 5-min 1-on-1 after lunch. |  |
| **13:00** | **Lab 1: Research** | **Information Synthesis.** Using Gemini to "chew" through complex Sarcopenia medical jargon. | Seeing 10 pages of clinical text turned into 5 bullet points for a layman. |
| **14:15** | **Lab 2: NotebookLM** | **Source Grounding.** Transition from the "Open Web" to "My Private Library." | The first time they hear the "Deep Dive" Audio Overview discuss *their* specific name or notes. |
| **15:30** | **Showcase** | **Social Proof.** Students show their "Personal Health Plan" or "NotebookLM Podcast" to their neighbors. | Realizing that 20 people in one room solved 20 different problems simultaneously. |
| **16:00** | **Wrap Up** | **Closing the Loop.** Final Quiz and "One-Week Challenge" commitment. | Transforming "I learned this" into "I will use this on Monday." |

#### **Module 1: The "Auto-Complete" Analogy (The Science)**

* **The Concept:** Explain that LLMs don't "know" facts; they predict "tokens."
* **Trainer Script:** "Think of a library where all the books were put into a giant blender. The AI doesn't remember the books; it remembers the *flavor* of how humans put words together. That’s why it’s so creative, but also why it needs you to double-check its facts."

#### **Module 2: The PRTC Workshop (The Skill)**

* **The Drill:** Give them a "Bad Prompt" (e.g., *"Write an exercise plan"*) and have the class "Meat it up" using PRTC.
* **Common Trap:** Students often forget the **Constraints (C)**. Remind them: "Telling the AI what *not* to do is as important as telling it what *to* do."

#### **Module 3: The Sarcopenia Lab (The Impact)**

* **Why Sarcopenia?** It is a high-stakes but non-controversial topic. It proves AI can handle "scary" medical info and make it "safe."
* **The Pivot:** Halfway through, tell them: "Now tell Gemini you only have two dumbbells and a chair. Watch how the plan changes instantly."

### 3. Expanded Knowledge Check (`assessments/knowledge-checks.md`)

*Inject these into your `final-quiz.html` or use them for "Hand-raising" breaks.*

| Level | Question | Logic for Trainer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Beginner** | Why does AI "hallucinate"? | To test if they understand it's a *probability* engine, not a database. |
| **Intermediate** | What is the difference between "Breadth" (Gemini) and "Grounding" (NotebookLM)? | To ensure they know which tool to pick for which task. |
| **Advanced** | If I want to summarize a 50-page PDF of my own medical records, which tool is safer? | **Answer:** NotebookLM (Source-grounding prevents external data leaks). |

### 4. The "Trainer’s Emergency Kit" (New Section)

*What to do when things go wrong:*

* **The "Wifi is Down" Backup:** Have a printed "Prompt Engineering Worksheet" where students write prompts by hand. You can "act" as the AI and write responses on a whiteboard to show the logic.
* **The "I'm Overwhelmed" Student:** If a student feels AI is "too much," pivot them to a simple task: "Ask Gemini to write a polite email to your landlord." Small wins build the bridge to big labs.
* **The "AI Skeptic":** If someone says "Google does this already," show them **NotebookLM's Audio Overview**. Google Search cannot turn a PDF into a 2-person podcast. That usually ends the skepticism.
