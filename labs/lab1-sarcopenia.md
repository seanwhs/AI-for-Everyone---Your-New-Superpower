# 🧪 Lab Guide: The Sarcopenia Project

## Objective

Create a **senior-friendly educational video** on sarcopenia by:

1. Generating a clear, non-technical article with AI
2. Saving it as a PDF
3. Converting the PDF into a short explainer video using a **free AI video generation tool** (Fliki)

This lab demonstrates how **one well-written document** can be transformed into multimedia content with minimal effort.

## Step 1: Generate the Article (Gemini)

1. Open **Gemini**
   👉 [https://gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)

2. Paste the following prompt **exactly** into Gemini:

```
Write a 1,000-word article titled “Muscle Strength for Seniors: Beating Sarcopenia.”

The article should explain sarcopenia in clear, non-technical language and emphasize that muscle strength can be rebuilt at any age.

Include two core sections:

1. Safe, Equipment-Free Strength Training

List and explain 5 senior-safe exercises (e.g., chair squats, wall push-ups, heel raises, bird-dogs, standing side leg lifts).

Provide simple instructions, safety cues, and daily-life benefits for each exercise.

Emphasize balance, fall prevention, and independence rather than appearance or intensity.

2. Nutrition for Muscle Maintenance & Growth

Explain the importance of adequate protein intake for seniors (including anabolic resistance).

Recommend practical protein targets per meal (not just per day).

Include examples of easy-to-digest, senior-friendly protein foods (e.g., eggs, fish, yogurt, tofu, beans).

Briefly cover hydration and key nutrients that support muscle function (e.g., vitamin D, omega-3s).

Use a warm, encouraging, and confidence-building tone.
Avoid fitness hype or medical jargon.
Focus on safety, consistency, and quality of life.
```

3. Review the generated article:

   * Ensure language is calm and senior-appropriate
   * Confirm all 5 exercises are clearly explained
   * No medical jargon or aggressive fitness claims

---

## Step 2: Save the Article as a PDF

1. Copy the final article into a **Google Doc**.

2. From Google Docs:

   * Click **File → Download → PDF (.pdf)**

3. Save the file as:

   ```
   sarcopenia-guide.pdf
   ```

📌 *This PDF will be the single input for the video generation step.*

---

## Step 3: Generate a Video from the PDF (Free AI Tool)

1. Open **Fliki (Free AI Video Generator)**
   👉 [https://fliki.ai](https://fliki.ai)

2. Sign up for a free account.

3. Select **Text or PDF to Video**.

4. Upload your PDF:

   ```
   sarcopenia-guide.pdf
   ```

5. Let Fliki automatically:

   * Convert sections into slides/scenes
   * Generate AI voice narration (choose a calm, friendly voice)
   * Apply simple visuals

6. Make light adjustments if needed:

   * Large, readable fonts
   * Simple icons or illustrations
   * Slow, clear pacing
   * Minimal background music

7. Export the final output as an **MP4 video**.

📌 *Focus on readability, calm pacing, and accessibility for seniors—not flashy effects.*

## Deliverables

By the end of this lab, you should have:

* ✅ A 1,000-word AI-generated article
* ✅ A PDF health guide for seniors
* ✅ A short AI-generated educational video

---

## Key Learning Takeaway

This lab shows how **AI can turn written knowledge into accessible video education** with almost no technical setup:

> **One prompt → one PDF → one video**

The focus is on:

* Clear communication
* Safety-first health education
* Improving quality of life for seniors

---

## Reflection & Assessment Questions

**Purpose:** Encourage learners to think critically about the content, the workflow, and the impact of AI-generated health materials for seniors.

---

### **Reflection Questions**

1. What was the most important insight you gained about **sarcopenia** and its effects on seniors?
2. How did the exercises in the article focus on **balance, fall prevention, and independence** rather than strength or appearance?
3. Which section of the article (strength training vs. nutrition) do you feel will be most immediately useful to a senior audience, and why?
4. How did converting the PDF into a video change your understanding of **content accessibility**?
5. What challenges did you encounter when reviewing the AI-generated text for clarity and senior-friendliness?

---

### **Assessment Questions**

1. List **five exercises** recommended for seniors in the article and **describe one daily-life benefit** for each.
2. Explain why **protein intake is important for seniors**, and give an example of a protein source suitable for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
3. What are **two safety cues** that should always be considered when seniors perform the exercises?
4. Describe **one key design choice** that makes a video suitable for seniors (e.g., pacing, font size, visuals).
5. Why is it important to **review and refine AI-generated content** before sharing it with a senior audience?
