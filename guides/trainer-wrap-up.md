### 🎤 The Trainer’s Final Wrap-Up: "The Superpower in Your Pocket"

**(Place: Deliver this after the final lab, right before they open `final-quiz.html`)**

"Before we move to our final knowledge check and award your certificates, I want you to take a look at your phone or your laptop.

This morning, those devices were just tools for checking email or reading the news. But after today, they are something different. They are now your **Creative Partners**.

We’ve seen how AI can take a scary medical term like *Sarcopenia* and turn it into a simple, life-saving exercise plan. We’ve seen how it can solve an Excel formula that used to take an hour, or plan a family meal out of a few random ingredients in your fridge.

The 'Superpower' we talked about today isn't the AI—**it’s you.** The AI is just a very well-read librarian. It needs *your* curiosity, *your* context, and *your* 'PRTC' prompts to bring that knowledge to life. You are the captain; the AI is just the co-pilot.

Go home tonight and try one small thing. Plan a weekend walk, draft a tricky email, or ask Gemini to explain a hobby you’ve always been curious about. The more you talk to it, the more you’ll realize that the future isn't something to fear—it’s something you can now participate in.

Thank you for your energy today. Let’s head into the final assessment and celebrate what you’ve achieved!"
