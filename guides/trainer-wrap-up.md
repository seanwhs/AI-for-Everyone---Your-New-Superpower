### 🎤 Trainer’s Final Wrap-Up: *"The Superpower in Your Pocket"*

**(Deliver after the final lab, before `final-quiz.html`)**

**Opening Pause & Gesture:**
*(Hold up a phone or laptop, make eye contact, pause 2–3 seconds)*

*"Before we move to our final knowledge check and award your certificates… take a moment and really look at your phone or laptop."*

**Slow, reflective pace:**
"This morning, those devices were just tools—for checking email, reading the news, scrolling social media.
But after today, they are something else entirely. They are now your **creative partners**."

**Gesture:** Sweep hands to encompass the room, emphasize “creative partners.”

**Engaged storytelling tone:**
"We’ve seen AI take a scary medical term like *sarcopenia* and turn it into a simple, life-saving exercise plan.
We’ve seen it solve an Excel formula that used to take an hour…
…and generate a meal plan from a handful of ingredients in your fridge."

**Lean in, lower tone for emphasis:**
"But here’s the key—the ‘superpower’ we’ve been talking about today isn’t the AI. It’s **you**."

**Gesture:** Point to yourself, then outward to the group.

"The AI is like a brilliant, extremely fast librarian. It needs:

* **Your curiosity**
* **Your context**
* **Your P.R.T.C. prompts**
  …to turn knowledge into action. You are the captain; AI is your co-pilot."

**Encouraging, upbeat tone:**
"So tonight, try one small experiment:

* Plan a weekend walk
* Draft that tricky email
* Ask Gemini to explain a hobby you’ve always been curious about"

**Pause, smile, let it sink in:**
"The more you interact, the more you’ll realize: the future isn’t something to fear. It’s something you can actively shape."

**Closing, confident & celebratory tone:**
"Thank you for your energy, focus, and curiosity today.
Let’s head into the final assessment and celebrate everything you’ve achieved!"
