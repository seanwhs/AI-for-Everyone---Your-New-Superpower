# 🚀 AI Mastery Cheatsheet

This cheatsheet summarizes the core concepts from the **AI for Everyone** workshop. Use it as a quick reference to turn your AI into a high-performing "digital intern."

## 💡 Section 1: AI Foundations

* **The "Fallible Intern" Rule:** Treat AI as a brilliant but inexperienced intern. It is fast and knowledgeable but lacks life experience and common sense. **You are the Supervisor.**
* **Augmentation, not Replacement:** AI handles the **Execution** (writing, calculating, summarizing) so you can focus on the **Strategy** (decision-making, ethics, goals).
* **Advanced Statistics:** Remember, AI doesn't "know" facts; it predicts the most likely next piece of information based on patterns.

## ⚙️ Section 2: How AI "Thinks" (LLMs & Tokens)

* **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Autocomplete on steroids trained on billions of human conversations.
* **Tokenization:** The process of breaking text into "Lego bricks" called tokens.
* *Example:* `Unbelievable` → `[un]` + `[believ]` + `[able]`.
* *Why it matters:* AI understands grammar and meaning by seeing how these "bricks" fit together (e.g., `[ed]` always means past tense).

## 🛠️ Section 3: Choosing the Right Tool

| Feature | **Google Gemini** | **NotebookLM** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Best For** | Creative brainstorming, latest news, live web searches. | Analyzing specific PDFs, private notes, or medical reports. |
| **Source of Truth** | The entire internet (higher chance of "hallucinations"). | **Your** uploaded files (cites sources directly). |
| **Superpower** | Generative creativity (poems, code, travel plans). | Grounded precision (RAG technology). |

## ✍️ Section 4: The P.R.T.C. Prompting Framework

Stop "chatting" and start "commanding" using this 4-part formula:

* **P — Persona:** Assign a role. *(e.g., "Act as a Senior HR Manager")*
* **R — Request:** State the specific task. *(e.g., "Rewrite this resume bullet point")*
* **T — Target/Template:** Define the format. *(e.g., "Use a table," or "Write a 3-sentence email")*
* **C — Constraints:** Set the boundaries. *(e.g., "Use no jargon," "Max 50 words," or "For a 10-year-old")*

## ⚠️ Section 5: Safety & Ethics

* **Hallucinations:** AI can confidently state lies because they are "mathematically likely." **Always verify critical facts.**
* **Overfitting vs. Underfitting:** * *Overfitting:* The AI is too specific (memorizes patterns that don't apply to new situations).
* *Underfitting:* The AI is too vague (misses the important details).


* **Privacy:** Never upload Sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) like ID numbers or bank passwords to public AI tools.

## 🏁 Final Action Checklist

1. **Check the Tokenization:** If an AI is struggling with a word, try hyphenating it or breaking it up.
2. **Describe the Logic:** For Excel or coding, describe the **step-by-step logic** instead of asking for the final answer.
3. **The "Ask Me Questions" Hack:** If you aren't sure how to prompt, say: *"I want you to do [Task]. Ask me 5 questions so you can do this perfectly."*
