# ⚡ AI Quick-Reference Cheat Sheet (Updated)

## 💬 How to “Prompt” AI

Use **P.R.T.C.** to get actionable answers every time:

* **Persona:** “Act as a [Chef / Teacher / Doctor / Expert]”
* **Request:** “Tell me [what you want]”
* **Target:** “For a [Beginner / Toddler / Expert]”
* **Constraints:** “Using only [X] / Under [100 words / 5 steps]”

## 🧠 Quick ML/AI Tips

* **AI ≠ Magic:** It predicts what comes next based on **patterns**.
* **LLMs “read” billions of texts** → good at language, summarization, and reasoning.
* **Tokenization:** AI sees text in **small chunks (tokens)** like Lego bricks.
* **ML Types:**

  * **Supervised:** Learns from labeled data (e.g., kNN).
  * **Unsupervised:** Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., k-Means).
  * **Reinforcement:** Learns by trial & error, optimizing rewards.
* **Overfitting:** Learns noise → fails on new data.
* **Underfitting:** Fails to capture patterns → poor predictions.
