This guide is your companion for today's workshop. Don't worry about memorizing everything—AI is about **conversation**, not coding. If you can send an email, you can use AI.

## 🧭 The Golden Rule of Prompting: "P.R.T.C."

When you talk to an AI (like Gemini), don't just give it a one-word command. Use the **P.R.T.C.** method to get the best results:

1. **P**ersona: Tell the AI who it is (e.g., "Act as a professional chef").
2. **R**equest: Tell it exactly what to do (e.g., "Write a recipe for dinner").
3. **T**arget: Who is this for? (e.g., "For a family with 2 toddlers").
4. **C**onstraints: Any rules? (e.g., "Must be under 30 minutes and no nuts").

### 1. Google Gemini (The Brainstormer)

* **Best for:** Searching the web, writing first drafts, and getting creative ideas.
* **Try this:** "Gemini, I have eggs, spinach, and feta. Give me 3 quick lunch ideas."

### 2. NotebookLM (The Personal Assistant)

* **Best for:** Understanding *your* files. You give it the information, and it stays "grounded" in those facts.
* **Try this:** Upload a long insurance document and ask, "Does this cover water damage?"

**AI can "Hallucinate":** Sometimes AI sounds very confident but is actually wrong. Always double-check important health, financial, or legal information with a human professional!
