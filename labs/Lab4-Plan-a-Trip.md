To enhance this labsheet, I have refined the formatting for better readability, added **pro-tips** specifically for a Singapore-based traveler, and sharpened the technical prompts to ensure the AI gives you the most accurate 2026 data.

# 📂 Lab: AI Travel Co-Pilot Workshop

**Subject:** Digital Planning for Cross-Border Logistics

**Case Study:** Pontian, Johor, Malaysia (Jan 2026)

**Objective:** To master Generative AI tools for high-efficiency, budget-conscious trip planning ($500 SGD cap).

---

## 🟢 Part 1: The "Master Prompt" (Strategic Brainstorming)

*Generic prompts yield generic results. We will use "Role-Based Prompting" to get a professional-grade itinerary.*

**Task:** Copy and paste the prompt below into Gemini or ChatGPT.

> **Master Prompt:**
> "Act as a local Johor travel expert. Plan a **3-day itinerary for a couple** visiting **Pontian** in **January 2026**.
> * **Budget:** S$500 total (inclusive of transport from Singapore).
> * **Food Priorities:** Authentic Pontian Wanton Mee (with tomato sauce), Kelong-style seafood, and local Kopitiam culture.
> * **Activities:** Sightseeing at the Southernmost point of mainland Asia and shopping for local SME products (belacan, pineapple jam).
> * **Style:** No 'tourist traps.' Group activities geographically to minimize travel time between Pontian Kechil and Kukup.
> * **Tone:** Concise and practical."
> 
> 

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Did the AI distinguish between **Pontian Kechil** (the town) and **Kukup** (the stilt village)?
* [ ] Did it suggest a specific "Kelong" or over-water dining experience?

## 🟡 Part 2: Fact-Checking & Live Data Verification

*AI can be over-confident. Since it is currently January 2026, we must check for real-time monsoon impacts.*

**Task:** Use a search-enabled AI to verify these high-stakes details:

1. **Weather Check:** *"What is the current 3-day weather forecast for Pontian? Are there any flood warnings or high-tide alerts for Kukup Laut today?"*
2. **Customs/Traffic:** *"What are the peak congestion hours for Tuas Second Link today? Suggest the best time to cross to avoid a 3-hour jam."*
3. **Price Check:** *"What is the current 2026 entry fee for Tanjung Piai National Park for 'Foreigners' vs 'PRs'?"*

---

## 🔵 Part 3: Visual & Logistic Mapping

*Spatial awareness is key to avoiding "backtracking" (driving back and forth).*

**Task:** Open **Google Maps** alongside your AI.

1. **Route Optimization:** Ask the AI: *"I am starting from Tuas Link. Should I visit Pekan Nanas on the way to Pontian, or on the way back to Singapore for maximum efficiency?"*
2. **Security & Safety:** Ask: *"Where is the safest place to park a Singapore-registered vehicle overnight in Pontian Kechil? Suggest hotels with gated/guarded parking."*

## 🔴 Part 4: The Budget Breakdown ($500 SGD Target)

*January 2026 exchange rates may fluctuate. Ensure your S$500 stretches far enough.*

**Task:** Request a structured table with an "Emergency Buffer."

**Prompt:** *"Create a budget table in S$. Exchange rate S$1 = RM 3.3. Allocate a 10% 'Emergency Buffer' for unexpected Grab rides or weather-related changes."*

| Category | Item | Budget (S$) | Budget (RM) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Transport** | Cross-border Bus / Local Grab | $100 | RM 330 |
| **Lodging** | 2 Nights (Guarded Parking) | $120 | RM 396 |
| **Food** | 2 Seafood Dinners + Local Eats | $160 | RM 528 |
| **Shopping** | Local Crafts & Food Souvenirs | $70 | RM 231 |
| **Buffer** | 10% Contingency | $50 | RM 165 |
| **TOTAL** |  | **$500** | **RM 1,650** |

## 🟣 Part 5: Final Review & Export

*Make the data "Actionable" for your mobile device.*

**Task:** 1. **The "Cheat Sheet":** Ask: *"Give me a 1-page summary of this trip. Use Emojis for categories and bold text for restaurant names so I can read it easily on my phone while walking."*
2. **The "Security" Packing List:** Ask: *"As a security professional, suggest a safety-first packing list for a coastal trip in the monsoon season (e.g., waterproof bags, power banks, torchlights)."*

---

## 📝 Lab Reflection (The "Human Touch")

*To be completed after your session:*

1. **AI Discovery:** Did the AI suggest a unique stop (e.g., the **Ark Mansions** or **Nictar Pineapple Park**)? ____________________
2. **Logistics Check:** Did the AI account for the **VEP (Vehicle Entry Permit)** or **MDAC (Malaysia Digital Arrival Card)**? ____________________
3. **The SGH Officer Perspective:** Comparing a 12-hour shift to a 3-day trip, which requires more "crowd control" planning? ____________________
