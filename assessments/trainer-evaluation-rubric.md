# 🏅 Workshop Evaluation & Certification Rubric

Since this is a competency-based workshop, we don't use letter grades. Instead, we use a **"Superpower Readiness"** scale. Trainers should use this to verify if a student is ready to receive their certificate.

## 1. The Competency Rubric

| Competency | Developing (Needs Help) | Proficient (Ready) | Advanced (Power User) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The PRTC Method** | Still uses 1-3 word "search" queries. | Consistently includes Persona, Request, and Target. | Uses complex Constraints to fine-tune specific formatting. |
| **Tool Selection** | Uses Gemini for private PDF analysis (risk of hallucinations). | Correctly chooses NotebookLM for "Source Grounded" research. | Seamlessly moves data from Gemini (creative) into NotebookLM (synthesis). |
| **Critical Thinking** | Accepts AI output as "The Truth." | Identifies at least one "hallucination" or generic response during labs. | Actively "Fact-checks" AI output against the source documents. |
| **Technical Flow** | Struggles with login or file uploads. | Can upload PDFs to NotebookLM and generate an Audio Overview. | Can customize the Audio Overview by guiding the AI "Deep Dive" questions. |

## 2. The "Certificate of Completion" Checklist
Before a trainer directs a student to the `final-quiz.html`, ensure the following are met:

- [ ] **Lab 1 Complete:** Student has generated a personalized Sarcopenia exercise plan in Gemini.
- [ ] **Lab 2 Complete:** Student has successfully "grounded" a source in NotebookLM and generated an Audio Overview.
- [ ] **Privacy Awareness:** Student can explain why we don't put sensitive personal data into the "Open Web" version of Gemini.
- [ ] **The "Final Quiz":** Student has achieved a 100% score on the `final-quiz.html` (2 out of 2).

## 3. Trainer’s "Graduation" Script
*At 16:00, when students are ready to claim their digital reward, the trainer should say:*

> "Congratulations! You’ve moved from being a consumer of AI to being a **Director** of AI. You now have the P.R.T.C. framework to handle any prompt, and the grounding skills to research safely. 
> 
> Please navigate to the **Final Quiz** link on the website. Once you pass, you will be granted access to your Digital Certificate. Please share your success on LinkedIn and tag #AIForEveryone so we can grow this community!"

## 4. Post-Workshop Trainer Tasks
*To be completed by the trainer within 24 hours of session end:*

1. **Email the Cohort:** Send the "Post-Course Follow-up" email from `registration/outreach-templates.md`.
2. **Review Feedback:** Check the Google Forms responses to identify which lab needs more "meat" or more time.
3. **Github Update:** If a student found a bug in the documentation, submit an 'Issue' or 'Pull Request' to the main repository.
