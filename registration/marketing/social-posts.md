## Post 1: The "Paradigm Shift" (LinkedIn/Professional)
**Goal:** Target professionals feeling overwhelmed by AI.

**Copy:**
Most people are using AI as a "glorified Google Search." They are leaving 90% of the value on the table.

In my upcoming 6.5-hour **AI for Everyone Mastery Workshop**, I’m teaching a different approach: The P.R.T.C. Framework. 

We move past simple questions and start building "AI Intelligence Extensions." From automating 5+ hours of your work week to synthesizing complex health research (like our Sarcopenia Lab)—this is about empowerment, not just automation.

## Post 2: The "Community Impact" (Facebook/Local Groups)
**Goal:** Target seniors, retirees, and lifelong learners.

**Copy:**
"Technology should be a fundamental right, not a barrier." 

I'm hosting a pro-bono workshop called **AI for Everyone**. We’re going to demystify the "magic" and show you how AI can help you organize your life, understand medical jargon, and even turn your personal notes into a "podcast" you can listen to while walking.

No technical background required. Just a curious mind and a Google account.
