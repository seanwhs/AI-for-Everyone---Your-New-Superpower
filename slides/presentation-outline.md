# 🎓 AI for Everyone – Workshop Slide Deck 

---

## **Section 0: Pre-Course Quiz**

**Slide 1 – Pre-Course Quiz**
*Goal:* Gauge baseline knowledge, no pressure. Helps learners self-assess and trainer gauge experience.

1. What does "AI" stand for?
2. Have you used ChatGPT, Gemini, or any AI tools before? (Yes/No)
3. Do you think AI is mostly for programmers?
4. One thing you hope AI can help you with today?

**Trainer Tip:** Encourage discussion, normalize curiosity, and reduce fear.

## **Section 1: Understanding AI**

**Slide 2 – What is AI?**

* AI = machines performing tasks that usually require human intelligence
* Works via **patterns, probabilities, and algorithms**
* Key idea: AI **augments humans**, it does not replace judgment

**Slide 3 – Layman Analogy**

* AI is like a **fallible, brilliant intern**
* Fast, mostly right, but needs **your guidance**
* Example: Predicting the next word in a sentence or summarizing text

**Slide 4 – Knowledge Check #1**
Q: Which best describes AI?
A. A robot that thinks like a human
B. A tool that predicts patterns and helps humans make decisions ✅
C. Magic that solves all problems instantly

**Trainer Tip:** Highlight that AI cannot "think" or "understand" like humans; it predicts patterns.

---

## **Section 2: Large Language Models & Tokenization**

**Slide 5 – Large Language Models (LLMs)**

* AI trained on **billions of texts** (books, websites, conversations) to predict patterns
* Analogy: **Autocomplete on steroids**
* Strengths: Write summaries, essays, translations, code snippets
* Limitation: Can hallucinate; output depends on **prompt quality**

**Slide 6 – Tokenization**

* Text is broken into **tokens** (letters, words, subwords)
* Analogy: Lego bricks → AI constructs sentences from pieces
* Helps AI understand context & predict coherent sequences

**Slide 7 – Why Hallucinations Happen**

* AI predicts the **most likely next token**, not facts
* Rare combinations or unseen topics → plausible but wrong outputs
* **Rule:** Humans verify, AI drafts; consider output as **first draft**

**Slide 8 – Knowledge Check #2**
Q: Tokenization is:
A. Breaking text into chunks ✅
B. Encrypting datasets
C. Splitting models
D. Organizing databases

---

## **Section 3: Gemini vs. NotebookLM**

**Slide 9 – Google Gemini: The Brainstormer**

* Creative, connected to **live internet**
* Great for brainstorming, drafting, summarizing online info
* High “temperature” → more diverse/creative outputs
* Example: “Write a wedding speech” or “Plan meals from leftover ingredients”

**Slide 10 – NotebookLM: The Librarian**

* Grounded in **your uploaded documents**
* Great for personal summaries, interactive learning, or audio guides
* Uses **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ensure factual consistency

**Slide 11 – Knowledge Check #3**
Q: To summarize your own PDF, which tool do you use?
A. Gemini
B. NotebookLM ✅

**Trainer Tip:** Explain Gemini = **breadth**, NotebookLM = **precision**.

---

## **Section 4: The P.R.T.C. Prompting Framework**

**Slide 12 – Why Prompting Matters**

* AI is **literal**: vague prompts → generic answers
* Structured prompts → actionable, reliable outputs

**Slide 13 – P.R.T.C. Method**

* **P — Persona:** Assign AI a role (e.g., “Physiotherapist”)
* **R — Request:** Specify the task (e.g., “5 senior-safe exercises”)
* **T — Target:** Define audience & tone (e.g., “For beginners age 70+”)
* **C — Constraints:** Word count, equipment, style, safety cues

**Slide 14 – Knowledge Check #4**
Q: PRTC helps you:
A. Write essays automatically
B. Craft **effective prompts for AI** ✅
C. Check grammar in a document

**Trainer Tip:** Demonstrate “bad prompt → PRTC prompt” live for clarity.

## **Section 5: Applying Knowledge – Sarcopenia Lab**

**Slide 15 – Lab Objective**

* Create **personalized exercise & nutrition guidance for seniors**
* Phase 1: Gemini → Draft research-based article
* Phase 2: NotebookLM → Convert into **audio guide**

**Slide 16 – Lab Steps (Gemini)**

* Prompt example: Include 5 safe exercises + nutrition + safety cues
* Focus on **balance, fall prevention, independence**
* Encourage learners to tweak for personal constraints (e.g., knee pain)

**Slide 17 – Lab Steps (NotebookLM)**

* Upload Gemini article as **PDF**
* Generate **audio overview**
* Headphones recommended
* Emphasize **grounded content**, less hallucination risk

**Slide 18 – Knowledge Check #5**
Q: NotebookLM is safer than Gemini for:
A. Brainstorming new ideas
B. Summarizing uploaded research ✅

---

## **Section 6: AI in Daily Life**

**Slide 19 – Quick Wins with AI**

* Excel formulas → tax/discount calculations
* Meal planning → using leftover ingredients
* Homework explanations → simple, clear breakdowns
* AI is **collaborative**, you verify outputs

**Slide 20 – Knowledge Check #6**
Q: Plan a 3-day walking tour for a senior citizen. Which AI tool?
A. Gemini ✅
B. NotebookLM

---

## **Section 7: Ethics & Hallucinations**

**Slide 21 – Hallucinations**

* AI can produce **plausible but incorrect outputs**
* Always **verify critical information**
* Treat AI as **first draft assistant**, not final authority

**Slide 22 – Knowledge Check #7**
Q: What should you do if AI gives a confident but strange answer?
A. Trust blindly
B. Verify with reliable sources ✅

**Trainer Tip:** Celebrate AI errors as learning moments.

---

## **Section 8: Machine Learning Essentials**

**Slide 23 – Core Concepts**

* Machine Learning = AI that **learns patterns from data**
* **Supervised Learning:** labeled data (e.g., kNN)
* **Unsupervised Learning:** unlabeled data (e.g., k-Means)
* **Reinforcement Learning:** trial-and-error optimization
* **Overfitting:** memorizes noise → poor generalization
* **Underfitting:** too simple → misses patterns

**Slide 24 – Knowledge Check #8**
Q: Overfitting occurs when:
A. Model learns noise + patterns → poor on new data ✅
B. Model generalizes well
C. Model ignores labels

---

## **Section 9: Lab 2 – Home & Work Use Cases**

* Use **PRTC** for best results

**Slide 27 – NotebookLM Integration**

* Upload recipes or tasks
* Generate shopping lists or troubleshooting guides

**Slide 28 – Knowledge Check #9**
Q: P.R.T.C. stands for:

* Persona, Request, Target, Constraints ✅
