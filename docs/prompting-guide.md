# 📝 AI Prompting Guide 

## 🎯 The Secret to Great AI Results

AI is **not a search engine**. You don’t give it keywords; you **have a conversation with context**. The better your instructions, the better the AI performs.

## 1️⃣ The P.R.T.C. Framework — Your Golden Formula

A prompt is like giving instructions to a **brilliant but literal intern**. Use P.R.T.C. to get precise, useful results:

| Component           | What it Means                        | Example                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P – Persona**     | Assign a role/job title to the AI    | Instead of “Give me a recipe,” say: **“Act as a professional Italian chef with 20 years of experience.”** |
| **R – Request**     | State exactly what you want it to do | “Write a dinner recipe for a healthy pasta dish.”                                                         |
| **T – Target**      | Specify the audience or reader       | “The recipe should be easy for a senior citizen with limited kitchen tools to follow.”                    |
| **C – Constraints** | Set boundaries or rules              | “Must be under 500 calories and contain no added salt.”                                                   |

💡 **Tip:** The more context and constraints you provide, the smarter the output.

### ✅ Knowledge Check #1 — P.R.T.C.

**Question:** Which part of P.R.T.C. ensures the AI writes for the right audience?
A. Persona
B. Request
C. Target ✔
D. Constraints

---

## 2️⃣ Chain of Thought — Step-by-Step Thinking

Complex tasks often fail if you ask for the **final answer directly**. Use a **stepwise approach**:

*Prompt Example:*

> “I want to start a small garden. **First**, ask me 3 questions about my space. **Then**, once I answer, suggest 3 plants that will grow well there.”

*Why it works:* The AI **pauses, asks clarifying questions, and builds the answer in logical steps**.

---

### ✅ Knowledge Check #2 — Stepwise Prompts

**Question:** Why use a “Chain of Thought” prompt?
A. It forces AI to think step-by-step ✔
B. It makes the AI work faster
C. It guarantees the first answer is perfect
D. It allows AI to ignore user input

---

## 3️⃣ Iterative Prompting — The Polishing Phase

Rarely does the first AI output meet your needs. **Refine it using follow-up prompts**:

*Examples:*

* “Make that shorter and more professional.”
* “Put the key points into a table.”
* “Re-write this for someone who has never used Excel.”
* “Give me three different options for that headline.”

💡 **Trainer Tip:** Encourage learners to see AI output as **a first draft**, not the final product.

---

### ✅ Knowledge Check #3 — Iteration

**Question:** What is the main purpose of iterative prompting?
A. To generate multiple unrelated answers
B. To refine and improve AI output ✔
C. To teach the AI new knowledge
D. To bypass constraints

## 4️⃣ Prompting for Gemini vs. NotebookLM

| Tool           | Style               | Example Prompt                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gemini**     | Creative & Open     | “Gemini, brainstorm 5 gift ideas for a retiree who loves gardening and tech.”                |
| **NotebookLM** | Grounded & Specific | “Based on the PDF I uploaded, what are the specific dates for the community center classes?” |

💡 **Tip:** Gemini = **exploration**; NotebookLM = **accuracy**. Use both for best results.

### ✅ Knowledge Check #4 — Tool Choice

**Question:** Which AI should you use to answer questions about a PDF you uploaded?
A. Gemini
B. NotebookLM ✔
C. Google
D. Excel
