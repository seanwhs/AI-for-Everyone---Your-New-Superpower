| Dish Name | Description | Why it Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mediterranean Pasta Toss** | Sautéed chicken and spinach tossed with pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, and crumbled feta. | The oil from the tomato jar acts as a built-in sauce base. |
| **"Cheat's" Stuffed Chicken** | Chicken breasts sliced open, stuffed with feta and sun-dried tomatoes, served over wilted spinach. | High protein, low carb, and looks like a restaurant dish. |
| **Kid-Friendly: Creamy "Pink" Pasta** | Diced chicken and chopped spinach in a mild sauce made by blending a few tomatoes with feta and pasta water. | The feta melts into a creamy sauce that hides the greens. |

### Step-by-Step Cooking Guide: Mediterranean Pasta Toss

Since you're short on time, this is the most efficient choice. We’ll use the "liquid gold" (the oil from the sun-dried tomato jar) to add instant depth of flavor.

**Prep time:** 5 mins | **Cook time:** 12 mins | **Serves:** 2–3

#### 1. The Pasta Base

* Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
* Add enough **pasta** for your group (penne or fusilli work best) and cook according to package instructions.
* **Crucial Step:** Before draining, scoop out about half a cup of the **starchy pasta water** and set it aside.

#### 2. Sear the Chicken

* While the pasta cooks, dice the **chicken breasts** into bite-sized pieces. Season with salt, pepper, and dried oregano (if you have it).
* Heat 2 tablespoons of the **oil from the sun-dried tomato jar** in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
* Add the chicken and cook until golden brown and cooked through (about 5–7 minutes).

#### 3. Build the Flavor

* Lower the heat to medium. Add the **sun-dried tomatoes** (sliced) to the pan with the chicken.
* Throw in the **wilting spinach**. Toss it around for about 60 seconds until it just begins to collapse.

#### 4. The "Melting" Finish

* Add the cooked pasta directly into the skillet.
* Crumble in the **feta cheese** and pour in a splash of that reserved **pasta water**.
* Toss everything vigorously. The feta will partially melt with the water to create a light, creamy coating.

#### 5. Serve

* Finish with a squeeze of lemon or an extra crack of black pepper. Serve immediately while the feta is soft!
