### 💡 Teacher's Pro-Tip: The "Verify" Step

Before the students move their text to NotebookLM, teach them one "AI Safety" trick. Ask them to prompt Gemini one more time:

> *"Gemini, please provide a list of the key medical facts you used in this article so I can verify them against reputable sources like the Mayo Clinic or NHS."*

### 📘 How to transition to NotebookLM

Once Gemini generates the article, instruct the students to:

1. **Copy** the article into a Google Doc or Save it as a PDF.
2. **Upload** that file to a new Notebook in **NotebookLM**.
3. **The "Magic" Moment:** Click on **"Notebook Guide"** in the bottom right and select **"Audio Overview"** (this is what generates the "Deep Dive" podcast-style audio/video conversation).
