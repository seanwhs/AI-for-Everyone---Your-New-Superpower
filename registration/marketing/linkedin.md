**Title:** "AI for Everyone: Empowering Professionals with Practical AI Skills"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we work, from automating routine tasks to enabling creative problem-solving. Our recent “AI for Everyone” workshop offered professionals practical, hands-on training in leveraging AI tools such as Google Gemini and NotebookLM.

Participants learned how to apply structured prompting (P.R.T.C.) to generate actionable outputs, distinguish between creative and grounded tasks, and integrate AI safely and ethically into workflows. By the end of the course, learners gained confidence using AI to streamline projects, optimize daily tasks, and explore new ideas.

For organizations, this workshop demonstrates that AI literacy is no longer optional—it’s a key competency. Whether planning strategic projects, creating content, or summarizing research, professionals can harness AI to enhance productivity and creativity without sacrificing oversight or ethical responsibility.

**Key Takeaways:**

* AI augments human capability, not replaces it.
* Gemini for creative breadth; NotebookLM for precise, grounded tasks.
* Structured prompts (P.R.T.C.) improve output quality.
* Human verification ensures reliability and ethical use.
