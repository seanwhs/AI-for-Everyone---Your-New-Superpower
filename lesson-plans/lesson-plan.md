## Section 1: Lesson Plan (9:00 - 16:30)

| Time      | Session                       | Trainer’s Tactical Objective                                                                                                    | The "Aha!" Moment                                                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **09:00** | **The Hook**                  | Icebreaking & fear reduction. Live demo of Gemini making a mistake to humanize AI.                                              | Students realize AI isn’t omniscient; it’s a fallible but powerful assistant.               |
| **10:30** | **Coffee Break**              | Trainer ensures all participants are logged into Gemini.                                                                        |                                                                                             |
| **10:45** | **Gemini 101**                | Mastering PRTC: moving from "Google Search" behavior to "Managerial Instruction."                                               | A short, 3-word prompt fails; a full PRTC prompt delivers a perfect meal plan.              |
| **12:00** | **Lunch**                     | Trainer identifies 2–3 students for 5-min check-ins after lunch.                                                                |                                                                                             |
| **13:00** | **Lab 1: Research**           | Information synthesis: Using Gemini to convert complex sarcopenia literature into clear, actionable guides.                     | Seeing 10 pages of clinical text transformed into 5 clear bullet points for a lay audience. |
| **14:15** | **Lab 2: NotebookLM / Fliki** | Source grounding & multimedia: Personalizing knowledge using NotebookLM; optionally generating an educational video with Fliki. | First time they hear their own PDF content turned into an audio/video narrative.            |
| **15:30** | **Showcase**                  | Social proof: Students share their "Personal Health Plan" or AI-generated audio/video with peers.                               | Realizing 20 people in one room created 20 unique solutions simultaneously.                 |
| **16:00** | **Wrap Up**                   | Closing the loop: Final quiz & "One-Week Challenge" commitment.                                                                 | Transforming "I learned this" into actionable use on Monday.                                |

## Section 2: The Architecture of Intelligence

### 2.1 Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)

* AI is **not magic**—it is a **statistical predictor** trained on billions of texts.
* **Analogy:** Think of AI like your phone’s autocomplete—but supercharged. It guesses the next word based on patterns it learned from all the text it has “read.”
* **Implication:** AI can mimic reasoning, coding, and creativity—but it does **not understand** concepts the way humans do.

---

### 2.2 Tokenization: How AI Sees Words

* AI doesn’t see words the way we do; it sees **tokens** (chunks of letters, words, or subwords).
* It constructs answers by analyzing **relationships and patterns between tokens**, not by recalling meanings.
* **Result:** AI can excel at structured tasks like coding or math but may misinterpret poetic language or subtle humor.
* **Example:** “chair squats” and “wall push-ups” are tokens it can combine into a clear exercise guide, even if it doesn’t “know” what a squat feels like.

---

## Section 3: The Two Pillars — Gemini vs. NotebookLM

### 3.1 Google Gemini: Broad-Spectrum Creativity

* **Strength:** Access to live internet and high creative freedom.
* **Best Use:** Brainstorming, summarizing broad topics, or generating real-time insights.
* **Example:** “Write a wedding speech” or “Translate 2026 travel rules.”

### 3.2 NotebookLM: Precision & Grounding

* **Strength:** Restricted to uploaded documents → highly accurate, **source-grounded** insights.
* **Unique Feature:** Converts static PDFs into interactive, conversational, or audio content.
* **Example:** Transform a sarcopenia PDF into a **personalized audio guide or mini-podcast.**

---

## Section 4: The PRTC Framework for Prompt Engineering

### 4.1 Why Simply “Asking” Isn’t Enough

* Prompts = Instructions. **Quality prompts = quality output.**
* Generic prompts yield generic results.
* Specific instructions with context produce **reliable, actionable outputs.**

---

### 4.2 The PRTC Method (Persona, Request, Target, Constraints)

* **Persona (P):** Assign AI a role.

  * *Example:* “Act as a physiotherapist.”
  * Ensures professional tone and domain-specific knowledge.

* **Request (R):** Specify the task.

  * *Example:* “List 5 senior-friendly exercises.”
  * Defines whether AI summarizes, lists, critiques, or analyzes.

* **Target (T):** Define audience & tone.

  * *Example:* “Explain for a 70-year-old beginner.”
  * Adjusts simplicity, clarity, and examples.

* **Constraints (C):** Boundaries for length, style, or content.

  * *Example:* “Max 200 words; only chair or dumbbell exercises.”
  * Prevents hallucinations or overly generic content.

**Tip:** “Constraints are as important as instructions—they keep AI safe, relevant, and user-friendly.”

---

## Section 5: Applying Knowledge — Sarcopenia Case Study

### 5.1 From Science to Action

* **Phase 1:** Gemini converts dense clinical research into **plain-language exercise and nutrition guides**.
* **Phase 2:** NotebookLM analyzes your PDF to answer questions like, “Which exercises should I skip if I have knee pain?”
* **Optional Multimedia:** Fliki converts the PDF into a **2-min narrated video**, ideal for seniors.

**Example Prompt for Fliki:**

> “Take `sarcopenia-guide.pdf` and create a 2-min explainer video narrated in a calm, senior-friendly tone with simple visuals.”

*Outcome:* Personalized, actionable health plan in under 30 minutes.

---

## Section 6: Ethical Usage & Future Learning

### 6.1 Hallucinations & Human Oversight

* AI may confidently produce incorrect information.
* Always **verify critical outputs**—especially for medical, financial, or legal decisions.
* Treat AI output as a **first draft**, not final authority.

### 6.2 Continued Practice

1. **Reverse Prompt Exercise:** Determine the prompt that would produce a desired output.
2. **Multimodal Practice:** Ask AI to explain photos, diagrams, PDFs, or manuals.
3. **Community Engagement:** Join AI forums like **Google’s AI Discord** or **AI for Good** to see practical applications.

### 7.2 Team Readiness Assurance Test (TRAT)

* Students discuss IRAT answers in groups to reach consensus.
* Team discussion reinforces correct understanding and exposes misconceptions.
* Immediate feedback allows reflection and deeper retention.

---

## Section 8: Trainer’s Emergency Kit

* **WiFi Down:** Use printed prompt worksheets; trainer simulates AI on whiteboard.
* **Overwhelmed Student:** Assign small wins (e.g., draft a polite email).
* **AI Skeptic:** Show NotebookLM or Fliki outputs; Google Search cannot create interactive audio/podcast from a PDF.

---

## Section 9: Integration with Fliki

* **Fliki:** Converts PDFs → short narrated videos. Free plan supports concise clips.
* **Tip:** Keep narration calm, font large, visuals minimal, transitions slow.
* **Example Use:** Sarcopenia guide → 2-min senior-friendly video.
