# Lab: AI Travel Co-Pilot Workshop

**Subject:** Digital Planning for Cross-Border Travel

**Case Study:** Pontian, Johor, Malaysia (Jan 2026)

**Objective:** To leverage Generative AI to plan a budget-friendly ($500), interest-aligned (Seafood/Shopping) 3-day trip for two.

---

## Part 1: The "Master Prompt" (Strategic Brainstorming)

*In this section, we provide the AI with high-context data to avoid generic tourism results.*

**Task:** Copy and paste the prompt below into an AI (Gemini or ChatGPT).

> **The Prompt:** > "I am planning a 3-day trip to **Pontian, Johor** in **January 2026**. I am traveling with my wife. Our total budget is **S$500**.
> **Preferences:**
> 1. **Food:** High priority on authentic seafood and local Pontian Wanton Mee.
> 2. **Interests:** Sightseeing (nature/coastal) and local product shopping.
> 3. **Avoid:** Overpriced tourist traps.
> 4. **Constraint:** Group activities geographically to minimize driving/travel time.
> 5. **Output:** Provide a day-by-day itinerary including a mix of Pontian Kechil and Kukup."
> 
> 

**Checklist:**

* [ ] Did the AI include the **Southernmost Point of Mainland Asia (Tanjung Piai)**?
* [ ] Did it mention **Kukup Laut** (the stilt village)?

## Part 2: Fact-Checking & Live Data Verification

*General AI might not know about recent renovations or seasonal closures. January is the monsoon season in Malaysia, which can affect boat rides.*

**Task:** Use a search-enabled AI (like Gemini) to ask these specific verification questions:

1. *"What is the monsoon weather outlook for Pontian/Kukup in January? Does it usually affect boat tours to Pulau Kukup?"*
2. *"Verify the current entrance fees for Tanjung Piai National Park for non-Malaysian visitors in 2026."*
3. *"Are the Pontian Wholesale Fish Market bidding sessions open to the public on weekday mornings?"*

---

## Part 3: Visual & Logistic Mapping

*Moving from a list to a spatial understanding of the trip.*

**Task:** Use **Google Maps** or **Mindtrip.ai**.

1. **Map the Route:** Singapore  Pekan Nanas  Pontian Kechil  Kukup  Tanjung Piai.
2. **The "Efficiency Test":** Note that Tanjung Piai and Kukup are close together. Ensure your AI hasn't put them on separate days.
3. **Challenge:** Ask the AI: *"Suggest a hotel in Pontian Kechil that is walking distance to the seaside park and under S$60 per night."*

---

## Part 4: The Budget Breakdown ($500 Target)

*Ensuring the Singapore Dollar (S$) covers the Malaysian Ringgit (RM) expenses comfortably.*

**Task:** Request a structured table.

**Prompt:** *"Create a budget table for two people in S$. Use an exchange rate of 1:3.3 (or current). Include: Transport, 2 nights' accommodation, 2 seafood dinners, 2 breakfasts, and shopping for local products."*

| Category | Item | Est. Cost (S$) | Est. Cost (RM) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Transport** | Petrol/Tolls/VEP | $70 | RM 230 |
| **Lodging** | 2 Nights (Mid-range) | $120 | RM 400 |
| **Food** | Seafood & Local Eats | $180 | RM 600 |
| **Misc/Shop** | Belacan, Coffee, Fees | $130 | RM 430 |
| **Total** |  | **$500** | **RM 1,660** |

---

## Part 5: Final Review & Export

*Finalizing the plan for use during the 12-hour shift or on the road.*

**Task:** 1. **Consolidate:** Ask the AI: *"Summarize the final itinerary into a 'Short-Form' list that fits on one phone screen for easy reference."*
2. **Packing List:** Ask: *"Given the rainy season in January, what are 5 essential items to pack for a coastal trip to Pontian?"*

---

## Lab Reflection (The "Human Touch")

*To be completed after your AI session:*

1. **AI Discovery:** Did the AI suggest a hidden gem (e.g., the Pineapple Museum or a specific Kelong)? ____________________
2. **Critical Correction:** Did you have to correct the AI on the location of the Tuas Second Link? ____________________
3. **The 'Security' Lens:** As a security officer, did you identify any logistical risks (e.g., parking safety or road conditions) the AI missed? ____________________
