## 🧭 The Golden Rule of Prompting: **P.R.T.C.**

When talking to an AI like Gemini, use **P.R.T.C.** to get **better, safer, and actionable results**:

1. **P — Persona:** Assign a role (e.g., *“Act as a professional chef”*).
2. **R — Request:** Specify the task (e.g., *“Write a 5-step dinner recipe”*).
3. **T — Target:** Who is the output for? (e.g., *“For seniors learning at home”*).
4. **C — Constraints:** Add rules (e.g., *“No more than 20 minutes, no nuts”*).

> Think of PRTC as giving AI a **roadmap**—the clearer your directions, the more useful the answer.
