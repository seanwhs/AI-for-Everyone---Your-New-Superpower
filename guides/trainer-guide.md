# 🎓 The Trainer's Tactical Playbook

## 1. The Mindset: Empathetic Instruction
Most laymen are either **afraid** (AI will take my job/privacy) or **skeptical** (It’s just a toy). Your job is to be the "Calm Guide."

* **Avoid Jargon:** Don't say "Stochastic Parity" or "Neural Networks." Say "Smart Pattern Matching."
* **Encourage Mistakes:** Remind them that they can't "break" the AI.
* **The "Fallible Intern" Analogy:** Tell students: "Treat the AI like a very bright, very fast, but slightly overconfident intern. You are the Manager. You must check their work."

## 2. Managing the Tech (The "Safety Net")
* **The "Account Check":** Spend the first 15 minutes ensuring everyone can log into their Google accounts. If they use a corporate laptop, firewall issues may arise—have them use their personal phones as a backup.
* **The Bandwidth Warning:** NotebookLM’s "Audio Overview" generation is heavy. If the room has 20 people, suggest they "stagger" their audio generation (Group A first, then Group B) to avoid crashing the local Wi-Fi.
* **The "Hallucination" Moment:** If a student gets a weird or wrong answer, celebrate it! Use it to explain that AI is a *predictive* engine, not a database.

## 3. Handling "Difficult" Questions

| Question | Suggested Response |
| :--- | :--- |
| *"Is it stealing from writers?"* | "It's learning from patterns, like a student reading books. We use it to synthesize existing info into new personal value." |
| *"Can I trust medical advice?"* | "Never take it as a final word. It’s a 'starting point' to prepare you for a more informed conversation with your doctor." |
| *"Is it going to become sentient?"* | "It mimics humans perfectly, but it’s essentially an advanced 'Auto-complete.' It doesn't 'want' anything; it only predicts." |

## 4. Lab-Specific Secrets

### Module: The P.R.T.C. Drill
Before Lab 1, do a live demo. Ask the class for a bad prompt.
* **Bad:** "Give me a workout."
* **The Fix:** Work with the class to add **P**ersona (Physio), **R**equest (3-day plan), **T**arget (Seniors), and **C**onstraints (No equipment). 
* *Observation:* Watch for the "Aha!" moment when the AI response goes from generic to genius.

### Lab 1: Sarcopenia & Gemini
* **The Pivot:** If students finish early, challenge them: "Tell the AI you have a sore left knee. See how it adjusts the exercises."

### Lab 2: NotebookLM & Audio
* **The Environment:** This part gets loud. Encourage students to step into the hallway or use headphones to hear their "AI Podcast."
* **Grounding:** Emphasize that NotebookLM *only* knows what they uploaded. It won't "hallucinate" external facts as much as Gemini.
