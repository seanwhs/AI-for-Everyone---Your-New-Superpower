# 📘 Learner Guide — AI for Everyone

### *Your Companion to Exploring AI Safely and Effectively*

No coding required—if you can send an email, you can use AI. Think of AI as a **collaborative assistant**: it amplifies your skills, it doesn’t replace you.

## 👋 Welcome to the Future!

AI can help you:

* Research, summarize, and organize information
* Generate clear instructions, explanations, and plans
* Transform documents into **interactive guides or audio content**

Your focus: **ask clearly, check outputs, and apply safely**.

## 🧭 The Golden Rule of Prompting: **P.R.T.C.**

Use **P.R.T.C.** to guide AI responses. Think of it as giving AI a **roadmap**:

| Element             | What it Means                         | Example                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P — Persona**     | Assign a role                         | “Act as a professional physiotherapist”                    |
| **R — Request**     | Specify the task                      | “Create a 5-step home exercise routine”                    |
| **T — Target**      | Define the audience                   | “For seniors learning at home”                             |
| **C — Constraints** | Set limits on style, length, or tools | “Use only a chair or resistance bands; 2 min per exercise” |

> **Tip:** The clearer your directions, the more useful and safe the AI output.

## 🧪 Lab Cheat Sheet: Sarcopenia Project

### Step 1 — Research Phase (Gemini)

**Prompt Template:**
