# Registration Management (registration/readme.md)

## Google Form Setup
1. Create a Google Form with: Name, Email, Age Group, and "What is your experience with AI?".
2. Ensure "Collect Email Addresses" is turned on.
3. Link the form to the **Register** button on the `index.html` page.

## Manual Registration
If a learner cannot use the form, the trainer should:
- Manually add their details to the linked Google Sheet.
- Send a "Welcome Email" with the link to this GitHub Pages site so they can view the curriculum.
