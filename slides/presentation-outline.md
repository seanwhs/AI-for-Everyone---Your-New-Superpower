* Key idea: AI **augments humans**, it does not replace judgment.

---

### **Group Activity: Defining AI Together**

**Slide 3 – Group Activity: What is AI?**
*Goal:* Build a group understanding of AI.

* **Instructions:** Break into small groups (3-4 people). Discuss the following:

  * What does AI mean to you?
  * Can you think of an example of AI in your daily life?
* After 10 minutes, one person from each group shares their thoughts with the class.

**Trainer Tip:** Emphasize that there are no wrong answers; it’s about sharing experiences.

---

**Slide 4 – Layman Analogy**

---

### **Group Activity: AI Intern Simulation**

**Slide 5 – Group Activity: AI Intern Simulation**
*Goal:* Understand AI’s “intern-like” capabilities.

* **Instructions:** In pairs, role-play as an AI intern (one person is the intern, the other is the human supervisor). The intern will try to predict the next word or phrase based on a few sentences or context provided by the supervisor. After 10 minutes, swap roles.
* **Example Scenario:** “I’m going to make a sandwich with…”

  * The intern predicts: “ham, cheese, and bread.”

---

## **Section 4: The P.R.T.C. Prompting Framework**

**Slide 13 – Why Prompting Matters**

* AI is **literal**: vague prompts → generic answers.
* Structured prompts → actionable, reliable outputs.

**Slide 14 – P.R.T.C. Method**

* **P — Persona:** Assign AI a role (e.g., “Physiotherapist”).
* **R — Request:** Specify the task (e.g., “5 senior-safe exercises”).
* **T — Target:** Define audience & tone (e.g., “For beginners age 70+”).
* **C — Constraints:** Word count, equipment, style, safety cues.

---

### **Group Activity: Craft a P.R.T.C. Prompt**
