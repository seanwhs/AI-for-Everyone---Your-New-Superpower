# 📝 Registration & Enrollment Management

## The Funnel Logic
1. **Awareness:** Social posts (LinkedIn/FB) drive traffic to `index.html`.
2. **Action:** User clicks "Register" on `index.html`.
3. **Capture:** User fills out the Google Form.
4. **Retention:** User sees the `thank-you.html` and receives the "Welcome Email" (from `outreach-templates.md`).

## Tracking Success
* **Goal:** 10-15 students per cohort (to maintain instructor-to-student ratio).
* **Lead Source:** Check the Google Form spreadsheet to see which social post is working best.
