**Title:** "Discover How AI Can Transform Your Daily Tasks"

Curious about AI but unsure where to start? Our “AI for Everyone” workshop makes AI approachable and practical. Through interactive exercises and labs, participants explored AI tools like Google Gemini and NotebookLM, learning how to brainstorm ideas, summarize documents, and create personalized content.

The course introduced the P.R.T.C. prompting framework—Persona, Request, Target, Constraints—to help learners craft precise prompts that yield better results. Hands-on labs focused on real-life applications, from planning senior-friendly exercises to automating spreadsheets and meal planning.

Participants gained confidence, learned to identify AI hallucinations, and practiced verifying outputs responsibly. The workshop empowers learners to experiment with AI, improve productivity, and integrate intelligent tools safely into everyday life.

**Highlights for Learners:**

* Understand AI fundamentals and large language models.
* Apply structured prompting for actionable outputs.
* Select the right AI tool for creative vs. grounded tasks.
* Learn to verify AI outputs and ensure safety.
