# Trainer Guide 

## **1. The Mindset: Empathetic Instruction**

Most laymen are either **afraid** (AI will take my job/privacy) or **skeptical** (It’s just a toy). Your job is to be the "Calm Guide."

* **Avoid Jargon:** Don't say "Stochastic Parity" or "Neural Networks." Say "Smart Pattern Matching."
* **Encourage Mistakes:** Remind them that they can't "break" the AI.

## **2. Managing the Tech (The "Safety Net")**

* **The "Account Check":** Spend the first 15 minutes ensuring everyone can log into their Google accounts. This is where most sessions stall.
* **Internet Stability:** NotebookLM (especially the Audio/Video generation) is bandwidth-heavy. Ensure the venue Wi-Fi can handle 20 people streaming at once.
* **The "Hallucination" Talk:** If a student gets a weird or wrong answer, use it as a teaching moment. Explain that AI is a *creative* engine, not a *calculator*.

## **3. Handling "Difficult" Questions**

| Question | Suggested Response |
| --- | --- |
| *"Is it stealing from writers?"* | "It's learning from patterns, much like a student reads books to learn how to write. We use it here to synthesize and create new value." |
| *"Can I trust medical advice?"* | "Never take medical advice from AI as a final word. Think of it as a 'starting point' for a conversation with your doctor." |
| *"Is it going to become sentient?"* | "It’s very good at mimicking humans, but it’s essentially a very advanced version of your phone's 'Auto-complete'." |

## **4. The "Sarcopenia" Lab Secret**

When students generate the exercise routine, they might get different results.

* **Tip:** Ask a student who got a "Wall Push-up" to compare with someone who got a "Chair Squat."
* **The NotebookLM Moment:** When they generate the Audio Overview, the room will get loud. Encourage them to use headphones or step out to hear their specific "AI Podcast."
