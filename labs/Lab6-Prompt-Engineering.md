# 🧪 Lab 6: The Power of Prompt Engineering (P.R.T.C. Method)

It can be incredibly overwhelming to face a blank page or a complex set of data. Whether you are staring at a wall of "out of range" medical markers, a complex legal contract, or a blank screen when trying to write a resume, AI can act as your "intellectual jumpstart."

This lab demonstrates how to use the **P.R.T.C. Method** to move from generic AI responses to expert-level output across diverse real-world scenarios.

## 1. Why Prompt Engineering Matters

AI is a generalist by default. Without specific instructions, it gives average answers. By "engineering" your prompt, you unlock:

* **Domain Expertise:** Forcing the AI to "think" like a specialist (Doctor, Lawyer, Recruiter).
* **Structural Clarity:** Getting results in the exact format you need (Tables, Code, Essays).
* **Tone Control:** Shifting from "Academic" to "Empathetic" or "Aggressive" depending on the situation.

## 2. The P.R.T.C. Framework

To get high-value results, every prompt should contain these four components:

| Component | Definition | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P**ersona | **Who** is the AI? | "Act as a Senior Executive Recruiter." |
| **R**ole / Task | **What** is the job? | "Rewrite my resume bullet points." |
| **T**emplate | **How** is it formatted? | "Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)." |
| **C**ontext | **What** are the rules? | "Focus on leadership and keep it under 50 words per point." |

## 3. Diverse Use Case Scenarios

Participants: Choose **one** scenario below and apply the P.R.T.C. Method to see the difference in output quality.

### **Scenario A: The Career Pivot (Resume Building)**

* **The Problem:** Your resume is too "task-oriented" and doesn't show impact.
* **The P.R.T.C. Prompt:** "Act as a **Senior Technical Recruiter (P)**. **Rewrite these three bullet points (R)** to show quantifiable impact. Present them in a **bulleted list (T)**. **Context (C):** The target role is for a Manager position, so emphasize 'leading teams' and 'budget saved'."

### **Scenario B: The Critical Health Report (Data Literacy)**

* **The Problem:** Your blood test shows **LDL 165 (High)** and **HbA1c 5.9% (Prediabetic)**.
* **The P.R.T.C. Prompt:** "Act as a **Preventative Medicine Physician (P)**. **Analyze these lab results (R)** and explain the risks in **simple, non-alarmist language (C)**. Provide a **7-day meal plan table (T)** focused on lowering both sugar and cholesterol."

### **Scenario C: The Academic Essay (Writing Partner)**

* **The Problem:** You have a great argument but your essay structure is messy.
* **The P.R.T.C. Prompt:** "Act as an **Oxford University Writing Tutor (P)**. **Critique my essay outline (R)** for logical flow and strength of evidence. Provide your feedback as a **numbered list of improvements (T)**. **Context (C):** The essay is for a 300-level Sociology class; keep the tone formal and academic."

### **Scenario D: The Hard Conversation (Conflict Resolution)**

* **The Problem:** You need to tell a client their project is delayed without losing their business.
* **The P.R.T.C. Prompt:** "Act as a **Crisis Communications Expert (P)**. **Draft an email (R)** explaining a 2-week delay. Use an **empathetic but firm tone (C)**. Provide **three variations (T)**: one short, one detailed, and one focused on a discount offer."

## 4. Caveats: What AI Cannot Do

* **Verification:** AI can "hallucinate" facts or invent citations. Always verify medical, legal, or historical facts.
* **Human Nuance:** AI lacks "lived experience." It can suggest a resume change, but it doesn't know the specific culture of the company you are applying to.
* **Privacy:** Never input sensitive data (ID numbers, private company trade secrets) into public AI tools.

## Appendix: Comparing "Generic" vs. "P.R.T.C." Output

**Scenario: Writing a Resume Point for a Sales Job**

* **Generic Prompt:** "Write a sales resume point."
* *AI Result:* "Responsible for selling products and meeting monthly sales targets."


* **P.R.T.C. Prompt:** "Act as a **Sales Director (P)**. **Rewrite my sales experience (R)**. Use the **STAR method (T)**. **Context (C):** I exceeded my target by 20% and managed a team of five."
